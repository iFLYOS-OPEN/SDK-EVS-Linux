### Target board
We work on STM32F4 board for NuttX and the detail of the reference board is well described at [STM32F4-discovery with BB](http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/FM116/SC959/SS1532/LN1199/PF255417).

### Relation with STM board?
We do not have any business relation with STM board. It is selected because it has enough RAM and Flash ROM, so that development can be more comfortable. And it has lots of pins to play with.

When IoT.js is built up and optimized, it may work in devices having smaller resource.


### 1. Prepare for prerequisite

#### Linux

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install autoconf libtool gperf flex bison autoconf2.13
$ sudo apt-get install cmake libncurses-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libsgutils2-dev gcc-arm-none-eabi minicom
```

To use menuconfig in NuttX, you may need to install kconfig frontend.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jameswalmsley/kconfig-frontends.git
$ cd kconfig-frontends
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --enable-mconf
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
```

#### macOS

* Install Xcode from the app store and run once Xcode to install components.
* Install Xcode command line tools.
```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```
* Install [Homebrew package manager](http://brew.sh/)
* Install packages
```bash
$ brew tap PX4/homebrew-px4
$ brew update
$ brew install cmake bash-completion pkg-config kconfig-frontends
$ brew install gcc-arm-none-eabi libusb minicom
```


### 2. Set up the build environment for STM32F4-Discovery board

#### Supported Nuttx version
|Repository|Tag Name|
|----------|:------:|
| nuttx | nuttx-7.25 |
| app | nuttx-7.25 |

We only guarantee that the specified version will work well. It is recommended to check out with the specified tag from a git repository.

#### Clone repository

Clone IoT.js and NuttX into iotjs-nuttx directory

```bash
$ mkdir iotjs-nuttx
$ cd iotjs-nuttx
$ git clone https://github.com/pando-project/iotjs.git
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx.git --branch nuttx-7.25
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/apps.git --branch nuttx-7.25
$ git clone https://github.com/texane/stlink.git
```

Note that we only support the specified git tag from nuttx repository

The following directory structure is created after these commands

```bash
iotjs-nuttx
  + apps
  + iotjs
  |  + config
  |      + nuttx
  |          + stm32f4dis
  + nuttx
  + stlink
```


### 3. Build NuttX (For the first time)

To generate headers which are required to build IoT.js, for the first time, you need to build NuttX at least once. This time NuttX build will be failed. But don't worry at this time. After one execution, you don't need this sequence any more.

#### Add IoT.js as a builtin application for NuttX

```bash
$ cd apps/system
$ mkdir iotjs
$ cp ../../iotjs/config/nuttx/stm32f4dis/app/* ./iotjs/
```

#### Configure NuttX

```bash
# assuming you are in iotjs-nuttx folder
$ cd nuttx/tools

# configure NuttX USB console shell
$ ./configure.sh stm32f4discovery/usbnsh
```

Now you can configure nuttx like either of below. For convenience, we provide built-in configure file for you. (This configure file is equipped with modules specified as `always`. For `optional` modules, you might follow instructions below.)
```bash
$ cd ..
$ cp ../iotjs/config/nuttx/stm32f4dis/config.default .config
```

Or if you want to configure yourself, you can follow guide below.
```bash
$ cd ..
# might require to run "make menuconfig" twice
$ make menuconfig
```

#### Build NuttX Context

```bash
# assuming you are in iotjs-nuttx folder
$ cd nuttx/
$ make context
```


### 4. Build IoT.js for NuttX

These options are needed.
```bash
--target-arch=arm
--target-os=nuttx
--nuttx-home=/path/to/nuttx
--target-board=stm32f4dis
--jerry-heaplimit=[..]
```

For example,
```bash
$ ./tools/build.py \
--target-arch=arm --target-os=nuttx --nuttx-home=../nuttx \
--target-board=stm32f4dis --jerry-heaplimit=78
```

Library files will be generated like below when build is successful.

```bash
$ ls build/arm-nuttx/release/lib
libhttpparser.a libiotjs.a libjerrycore.a libtuv.a
```

### 5. Build NuttX

```bash
# assuming you are in iotjs-nuttx folder
$ cd nuttx/
$ make IOTJS_ROOT_DIR=../iotjs
```
For release version, you can type R=1 make on the command shell.


### 6. Flashing

Connect Mini-USB for power supply and connect Micro-USB for `NSH` console.

To configure `stlink` utility for flashing, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/texane/stlink#build-from-sources).

To install,
```bash
# assuming you are in stlink folder
$ cd stlink
$ make
```

To flash,
```bash
# assuming you are in nuttx folder
$ sudo ../stlink/build/Release/st-flash write nuttx.bin 0x8000000
```


### 7. Run IoT.js

#### USB Connection

There are two USB Connections on the Target board. USB mini CN1 and USB micro CN5. Both USB ports need to be connected to your Host. CN1 is used for power and Flashing, but it will not appear as a device in Linux. CN5 is used for NSH and will appear as `/dev/ttyACM0(linux)` or  `/dev/tty.usbmodem1(macOS)` when things work well.

#### Use minicom

```bash
// linux
$ minicom --device=/dev/ttyACM0
// macOS
$ minicom --device=/dev/tty.usbmodem1

```
You may need to enable _Add Carriage Return_ option.
* Press <kbd>Ctrl-A</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> for short in minicom screen. (For linux user)
* Press <kbd>[Meta](http://osxdaily.com/2013/02/01/use-option-as-meta-key-in-mac-os-x-terminal/)</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> for short in minicom screen. (For macOS user)

Press _Enter_ key several times to trigger NuttShell to start.

If micro SD is enabled, you can copy any script file to it and run with _nsh_, for example;
```
NuttShell (NSH)
nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt/sdcard
nsh> iotjs /mnt/sdcard/path_to_file.js
```

If you see
```
+-----------------------------+                  
|                             |                  
|  Cannot open /dev/ttyACM0!  |                  
|                             |                  
+-----------------------------+
```
and it stays on the screen, something is wrong. Blue LED may blink if NuttX is in abnormal state. Press black(reset) button on the board and try again. If you still see this warning message, begin with original NuttX code and check your board, USB line and other softwares.


## EXTRA STM32 SUPPORT 

While STM32F4-Discovery is the reference target, 
IoT.js can be built for other based STM32 boards:

* [Nucleo-F767zi](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f767zi.html)

The procedure is similar to STM32F4, so only specific info will be explained in following chapters:

## NUCLEO-F767ZI

### 1. Prepare for prerequisite

See general instructions for STM32F4 in related chapter.

### 2. Set up the build environment for STM32F7-Nucleo board

#### Supported Nuttx version for NUCLEO-F767ZI

Since development is still in progress, master branch of NuttX will be used
until a version is released with relevant STM32F7 support.

#### Clone repository for NUCLEO-F767ZI

Clone IoT.js and NuttX into iotjs-nuttx directory:

```bash
$ mkdir iotjs-nuttx
$ cd iotjs-nuttx
$ git clone https://github.com/pando-project/iotjs.git
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx.git --branch master
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/apps.git --branch master
```
### 3. Build NuttX (For the first time) for NUCLEO-F767ZI

See general instructions for STM32F4 in related chapter.

#### Add IoT.js as a builtin application for NuttX for NUCLEO-F767ZI

See general instructions for STM32F4 in related chapter.

##### Configure NuttX for NUCLEO-F767ZI

See general instructions for STM32F4 in related chapter. but instead of configuring for discovery in STM32F4:

```bash
$ ./configure.sh stm32f4discovery/usbnsh
```

Nucleo-144 board configuration will be needed with STM32F7 MCU (with Network Controller support):

```bash
$ ./configure.sh nucleo-144/f767-netnsh
```

Now you can configure nuttx like either of below. For convenience, we provide built-in configure file for you. (This configure file is equipped with modules specified as `always`. For `optional` modules, you might follow instructions below.)
```bash
$ cd ..
$ cp ../iotjs/config/nuttx/stm32f7nucleo/config.default .config
```

### 4. Build IoT.js for NuttX for NUCLEO-F767ZI


These options are needed.
```bash
--target-arch=arm
--target-os=nuttx
--nuttx-home=/path/to/nuttx
--target-board=stm32f7nucleo
--jerry-heaplimit=[..]
```

For example,
```bash
$ ./tools/build.py \
--target-arch=arm --target-os=nuttx --nuttx-home=../nuttx \
--target-board=stm32f7nucleo --jerry-heaplimit=78
```
Library files will be generated like below when build is successful, at least expect to find:

```bash
$ ls build/arm-nuttx/*/lib
libhttpparser.a libiotjs.a libjerrycore.a libtuv.a
```

### 5. Build NuttX for NUCLEO-F767ZI

See general instructions for STM32F4 in related chapter.

### 6. Flashing for NUCLEO-F767ZI

See general instructions for STM32F4 in related chapter.

### 7. Run IoT.js for NUCLEO-F767ZI

See general instructions for STM32F4 in related chapter.
